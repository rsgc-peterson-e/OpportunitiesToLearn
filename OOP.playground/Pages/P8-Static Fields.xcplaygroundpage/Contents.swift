 # Type Properties
 
 Sometimes the zookeepers are getting confused about how many animals they're feeding and how many total animals are at the zoo. Just yesterday, Zeb the zookeeper said to ZoeBot, "Was I supposed to feed 3 bears and 5 bees, or 3 of the 5 bears?" Let's help them remember.
 
 To do this, we would like to add in a `population` counter in our `Animal` class, which keeps track of how many times an `Animal` has been instantiated. But this seems impossible, given what we know – all instance variables are unique to the _instance_ of the class, which means that such a variable wouldn't be able to count _across_ instances of a class...
 
 Enter _type_ properties!
 
 */
class AnotherExampleClass {
    static var counter = 8999
    var message: String
    
    init(message: String) {
        self.message = message
    }
    
    func increaseAndCheckTheCounter() {
        AnotherExampleClass.counter += 1
        print("\(self.message) \(AnotherExampleClass.counter)!")
    }
}
//AnotherExampleClass.counter
/*:
 
 In this example, we have an instance variable `message`, and a _static_ property `counter`, initialized to `8999`. After each call of `increaseAndCheckTheCounter()`, the type variable is incremented, and is printed, along with the `message` instance variable. Note that difference in the syntax as well: `message` is accessed from within the class as `self.message`, while `counter` is accessed as `AnotherExampleClass.counter`, signifying that the variable `counter` is _shared_ across the entire type `AnotherExampleClass`.
 
 The code below prints the following result. Can you explain why?
 
     What does your counter say? 9000!
     That can't be! It says it's... 9001!
 
 */
let instanceOne = AnotherExampleClass(message: "What does your counter say?")
let instanceTwo = AnotherExampleClass(message: "That can't be! It says... it's...")
instanceOne.increaseAndCheckTheCounter()
instanceTwo.increaseAndCheckTheCounter()
/*:
 
 # Type methods
 
 Methods can be marked as `static`, too. For example, if we subclassed `AnotherExampleClass` to create `CrushingExampleClass` and decided to add a method `crushTheCounter` to `CrushingExampleClass`, you would call it as: `CrushingExampleClass.crushTheCounter()`. You won't be able to access any instance variables from within a type method, though – this is because a type method is not tied to any given instance of the class.
 
 - callout(Try it out!): Add a call to `instanceThree.increaseAndCheckTheCounter()` and `CrushingExampleClass.crushTheCounter()` below to see it in action!

 
 */
class CrushingExampleClass: AnotherExampleClass {
    static func crushTheCounter() {
        CrushingExampleClass.counter = 0
        print("Don't worry... *crush* the counter reads \(CrushingExampleClass.counter) now!")
    }
}
let instanceThree = CrushingExampleClass(message: "WHAT! NO! It's now...")


/*:
 
 - note: You can actually use the keyword `class` in place of `static` _when writing type methods_. The difference is minute – a method marked with `class` allows one to _override_ the method implementation in a subclass, while a method marked with `static` does not allow this.

 # Back to the animals
 
 Now that you know how to use type properties, let's use them to count our `Animal` population.
 
 - callout(Challenge): Implement the new features on the Animal superclass below!
    - Add a type property `population` to the `Animal` class that counts how many instances of Animal have been created. Keeping track of this will require incrementing the count in the initializer method each time a new `Animal` object is initialized.
    - To make the count accessible, add a type method `populationCount` that simply returns the value of population.
    - Show the total Animal population whenever you call `feedAnimals`. Add a line to the top of the `Zookeeper.feedAnimals` method to print `"<name> is feeding <food> to <number of animals feeding> of <population> total animals"`.

 # Zookeeper
 
 Great! Now, we're ready to create a `Zookeeper` class that contains a `name` instance variable and an initializer method that sets `name` using an argument. A zookeeper needs to feed many animals each day, so let's add a `feedAnimals` method, which should take two arguments: `animals` – an array of `Animal`s, and `food` – a string. This method should first print `"<name> is feeding <food> to <animals.count> animals"`, then iterate over the array of animals and call each animal's `eat` method, passing the value of `food` as the argument.
 
 Finally, call this `feedAnimals` method, using an array containing an instance of each animal, and your own favorite food.
 
 - callout(Challenge): Finish the `Zookeeper` class below!
 
 */
// Copy your Zookeeper class here
class Zookeeper {
    // put instance variables here
    var name = ""
    
    init(name: String) {
        // save name to an instance variable
        self.name = name
    }
    
    func feed(animals: [Animal], food: String) {
        // complete your feedAnimals function here.
        print("\(self.name) is feeding \(food) to \(animals.count) animals")
        for i in 0...animals.count - 1 {
            animals[i].eat(food: food)
        }
    }
}
/*:
 ## Testing
 
 The following code is similar to the last one, except we add some more animals to our population, that aren't part of the array of animals getting fed. You should get the following output:
 
     Zoe is feeding meat to 5 of 10 total animals
     Tigger eats meat
     YUM!!! Tigger wants more meat
     Pooh eats meat
     Pooh hibernates for 4 months
     Rarity eats meat
     Rarity sleeps in a cloud
     YUCK!!! Gemma will not eat meat
     YUCK!!! Stinger will not eat meat

 ## Conclusion
 
 Congratulations! In this tutorial you learned about the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming – namely:
 
 - how to leverage the abstraction of classes in order to organize data
 - how to use class inheritance in order to make use of overlapping or similar behaviors
 - the difference between type and instance variables and methods
 
 Object-Oriented Programming is the basis of many complex programs. You'll be using these abstractions as core principles as you delve into many of your programming projects.
